        <h2 id="welcome-heading">Module Overview</h2>

        <div class="hero-text">
            <p>Welcome back to week 3, fabulous students!</p>
            <p>
                This week, we are discussing how to write a summary and anticipating how to organize your first essay.
                Remember, the concepts in this class are taught not for the sake of this class, but to teach you to effectively
                write for other classes and critically read anything for the rest of your life!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Importance of Summary</h3>
        <p>
            Summary writing is important because it shows that you’re able to discern what information is most important to capture
            the implicit and explicit meaning of a text. Consider this movie summary:
        </p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <strong>Interactive Challenge: Guess the Movie Summary</strong>
            <p>
                A mysterious criminal preys upon a large family’s home which results in the murder of a wife and her children.
                The only survivors are the husband and his disabled son. As time passes, the son becomes defiant due to the father’s grief.
                Yet in adolescence, the son is abducted into a larger network of trafficking. The widowed man embarks on a journey to find his
                abducted son. With the help of a deranged stranger, he overcomes a deluge of near-death experiences across his journey to the
                southern hemisphere. Caged and imprisoned, the son seeks to break from his cell with his fellow inmates. Through teamwork from
                both parties, the man and his son are reunited and return to their home with new skills for coping and control reflective of more
                healthy family dynamics.
            </p>
            <button class="btn-interact" onclick="toggleContent('summary-reveal')" aria-expanded="false">
                Reveal the Title
            </button>
            <div id="summary-reveal" class="hidden-content">
                <p>
                    This is the plot of <strong>Finding Nemo</strong>. Does it capture the implicit meaning of the text well? Maybe.
                    But what about the fish? What about the humor? What about Australia? What about the vegan Sharks?
                    Although it's understandable, it’s not exactly helpful.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Why Summary and Response Matter in the Academic Conversation</h3>
        <p>
            As we engage in the academic conversation and we share research with other academics like us, we must provide them with as much brief
            information as we can so they are better able to understand how ideas are formulated quickly and come to their own conclusions.
            If you provide an academic with precise information before convincing them of your argument, you are building your ethos, your credibility,
            and making a larger impact in the conversation. A well-read and clear speaker is more likely to be heard.
        </p>
        <p>
            Response writing is important because it allows you to direct the conversation based on the information you summarized. Many people seek
            to be heard and will work to steer the conversation away from what you value. Therefore, you must command their attention with your writing.
        </p>

    <!-- WRITING ABOUT WRITING / RHETORIC -->
    <section id="rhetoric" aria-labelledby="rhetoric-heading">
        <h2 id="rhetoric-heading">Writing About Writing</h2>

        <p>
            The summary and response essay is four paragraphs. This is short, but that means every word you write holds more weight.
            In this essay, you are not responding to the points made in the essay, you are arguing whether or not the rhetoric present in the essay is
            effective or ineffective. Then, you are providing examples of that rhetoric and explaining how the writing techniques used by the author
            appeal to the intended audience. <strong>You are writing about writing!</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            If we were rhetorically analyzing Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream Speech,” we would not talk about how it made us feel in 2024,
            we would write about how the language and rhetorical techniques he used appealed to his audience of Americans in 1963. Racism was a much
            larger issue in the 1960s, so the way Americans viewed race differed wildly.
        </p>

        <div class="example-box incorrect">
            <h3>Example: What NOT To Do</h3>
            <p><em>(Focusing only on the message/feelings)</em></p>
            <blockquote>
                When King states, “Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
                Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children” he argues that Black people are facing injustice, and it’s the
                right time to make a change in American society. Racism is an issue that effects all Americans, not just American people of color.
                By overcoming racism, America will become a more equal and ethical society which better reflects the society King dreams his children
                will be a part of.
            </blockquote>
            <button class="btn-interact" onclick="toggleContent('feedback-1')" aria-expanded="false">
                Why is this ineffective?

            <div id="feedback-1" class="hidden-content">
                <p>
                    Is this a good paragraph? It’s not bad. It’s direct and clear and makes a fair point.
                    But it doesn’t respond and assess the rhetoric of the speech. For the essay you’re writing, you identify how a quote rhetorically
                    appeals to a specific audience and whether or not it’s effective.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box correct">
            <h3>Example: The Right Thing To Do</h3>
            <p><em>(Focusing on Rhetorical Appeals)</em></p>
            <blockquote>
                When King states, “Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
                Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children” he argues that Black people are facing injustice, and it’s the
                right time to make a change in American society. By referring to Americans as God’s children, King is establishing his credibility
                from his experience as a Baptist minister. King’s audience of 1960s Americans were mostly likely a very religious group, so by framing
                his message about racism with religion makes his point more effective for this group of people.
            </blockquote>
            <button class="btn-interact" onclick="toggleContent('feedback-2')" aria-expanded="false">
                Why is this effective?

                <p>
                    The more effective paragraph is not writing about King’s argument but is instead writing about the rhetoric he used and how it’s
                    effective at appealing to a specific group of people. This is what you’re doing with Desmond or Parker.

                    <strong>Parker</strong> wrote a letter to George Henderson, a sociologist in the 1970s. Sociologists are people who study the way
                    people interact—how does Parker use <strong>ethos, logos, pathos, or kairos</strong> to appeal to those types of academics?
